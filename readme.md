# Non-blocking version of Array.forEach()

### What is it?
It creates a non-blocking version of .forEach(), allowing userâ€™s browser to still be responsive as the loop runs in the background. This way, UX will be smoother and we avoid freezing the webpage when iterating over a large array that takes a shit load of time. Internally, it runs 1 iteration of the loop at each clock tick, instead of stacking iterations as much as possible.

### How to use
Simply copy paste the function below into your .js file
```
function asyncEach(items, fn, i){
    if (items.length <= 0) return;
    if (i >= items.length) return;
    if (!i) i = 0;
    fn(items[i]);
    setTimeout(function(){
        asyncEach(items, fn, ++i);
    }, 0);
}
```
### Example
This will print 1 2 3
```
asyncEach([1,2,3], function(n){
	console.log(n); 
});
```
